# Climate--Temperature--Health---Using-Big Data

This project exploits the opportunities to mine large climate datasets, temperature datasets and a global
health and death dataset with an emphasis on the visualization of the mined data. I applied Big Data
technologies to analyze and draw correlations among the radical features causing climate change. 

Three data sets have been combined for the project:
1. Pollution levels in different cities in the United States
2. The Global Temperatures by City dataset
3. NCHS Leading Causes of Deaths: United States

The last step of the project was to use the Machine Learning Algorithms to predict tomorrow's temperature, by feeding the test set to the model. The project report gives a better understanding of the visualizations and project formulation.
